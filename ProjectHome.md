There are too few, readily available and open projects in <a href='http://www.kicad-pcb.org'>KiCAD</a> format. I'm working to change that -- by taking some I like and re-creating them in KiCAD.<br>
<br>
Why? Well, because it seemed a good idea and I seem to have the time.<br>
<br>
I'm starting with the good old Arduino UNO Rev.3, reference design. Obviously, my KiCAD version will not be an exact copy. In fact, I'll probably change the USB connector to USB-B-mini SMD. But otherwise, the circuitry will be the same, down to the socketed, DIP 'mega328. Maybe I'll do other versions later.<br>

Before the grand idea of re-creating multiple projects in KiCAD format came about, I had already completed a prototype <a href='http://kicad-freakduino.googlecode.com'>KiCAD version</a> of the <a href='http://freaklabs.org'>Freaklabs</a> Freakduino, with 2.4GHz radio on board. The learning I accomplished and the fun I had with that exercise, is more or less what led to this one.
